\title{Create adjacent rectangular polygons}
\usage{
rect_shade(x, y, fillcol = "grey", linecol = "black", lwd = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of x coordinates, arranged in ascending order}

\item{y}{Vector of y coordinates, arrange in acending order}

\item{fillcol}{A 1 to n - 1 length vector of colors for filling. n = length of x or y (the longest)}

\item{linecol}{A 1 to n - 1 length vector of polygon border colors. n = length of x or y (the longest)}
}
\value{
A polygon "chain": segmented polygons with interior vertical x or horizontal y axis
}
\description{
Generic function to create adjacent rectangular polygons from vectors of coordinates passed to
it
}
\details{
This is modeled on the rect_coords function used by flex_legend, but the resulting polygon
can be of arbitrary shape. It can be used to make either a horizontal (i.e. a sequence of polygons
separated on the X-axis, with the long dimension filling the Y-axis) or vertical chain of polygons (the
opposite). To make the former, provide a vector giving the X-coordinates separating each polygon, and a 2
parameter vector specifying the lower and upper Y coordinates. For the opposite case, give the left and
right X coordinates to X, and a vector of Y coordinates to Y.

a <- c(-50, -25, 0, 25, 50)
b <- c(-1, 21)
plot(c(-100, 100), c(-1, 22), pch = "")
rect_shade(b, a)

plot(c(-100, 100), c(-1, 22), pch = "")

cols <- sapply(c(0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1), function(x) rgb(1, 0, 0, alpha = x))

# rect_shade(b, a, fillcol = cols)
